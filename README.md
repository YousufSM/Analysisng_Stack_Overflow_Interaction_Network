# Analysing_Stack_Overflow_Interaction_Network
Understanding why do users participate in certain threads â€“ i.e., reply to certain questions?


This is my second Python project that I had submitted in December'19. The objective of this project is to study the interaction behaviour between participants on Stak Overflow network. 

Due to large image size, the results have not being saved in the .ipynb file and instead have been uploaded to the "Image" folder.

Since this was just my second project, there may be a possibility of inefficient codes/results.

Data for the analysis has been taken from [SNAP website](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-stackoverflow.html) and it consist of 4 DBs, namely, *comments to answers, comments to questions, answer to questions and a master DB* which the compilation of is former 3 DBs. Data consist of 7.6 years of user interaction on Stackoverflow.com.

Note: Since the project was a group work, I have only included my part of the project with due academic permission.
