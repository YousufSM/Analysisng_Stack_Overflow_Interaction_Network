# Analysing_Stack_Overflow_Interaction_Network
Understanding why do users participate in certain threads â€“ i.e., reply to certain questions?

Few notes about the project:
- This is my second Python project that I had submitted in December'19. The objective of this project is to study the interaction behaviour between participants on Stak Overflow network. 
- Due to large image size, the results have not being saved in the .ipynb file and instead have been uploaded to the "Image" folder.

- Since this was just my second project, there may be a possibility of inefficient codes/results.

- Data for the analysis has been taken from [SNAP website](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-stackoverflow.html) and it consist of 4 DBs, namely, *comments to answers, comments to questions, answer to questions and a master DB* which the compilation of is former 3 DBs. Data consist of 7.6 years of user interaction on Stackoverflow.com.

Note: Since the project was a group work, I have only included my part of the project with due academic permission.
